# Native functions implementations
Here, everything platform-dependant is implemented.

This includes:
* OpenGL loading
* Window management
* Probing OS informations (such as the version, the kernel...)

and more...

## Current implementations
For now, only these platforms are implemented:
* Linux with X.Org

You can contribute to the project to add a platform implementation (such as one for Windows, for Android, and even for your DIY OS)
